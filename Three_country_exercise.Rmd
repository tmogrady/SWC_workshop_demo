This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
three_countries <- subset(gap.in, country == "Canada" | country == "United States" | country == "Mexico")

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(three_countries, aes(year, gdpPercap, color = country)) + 
        geom_point(size = 3) +
        facet_wrap( ~ country)
names(three_countries)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
